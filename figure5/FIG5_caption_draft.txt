Figure 5. Root exudate and rhizosphere microbiome co-occurrence networks.
(A) Module-level summary of the exudate co-occurrence network. Nodes represent Louvain-detected modules; node size corresponds to the number of metabolites within each module; edge width reflects the number of significant inter-module correlations (Spearman |ρ| ≥ 0.8, BH-FDR < 0.05). Only the top 8 modules and top 15 inter-module edges are shown for readability (full network: Fig. S5A).
(B) Sparsified rhizosphere microbiome network at the genus level. The network was constructed from the top 40 most connected genera (prevalence ≥ 15%; Spearman |ρ| ≥ 0.6, BH-FDR < 0.05), retaining only the two strongest edges per node. Node color indicates Louvain module assignment; edge color distinguishes positive (red) from negative (blue) correlations; labels highlight the 12 most connected hub genera (full network: Fig. S5B).
(C) Network topology metrics for the two networks. Values include the number of nodes and edges, average degree, modularity Q, and the ratio of positive to negative correlations.
