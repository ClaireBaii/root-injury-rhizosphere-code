Figure 2. Root exudate metabolomic profiles in response to salinity treatments.

Heatmap visualization of the top 50 differentially abundant metabolites in poplar root exudates across five salinity treatments (YS0, YS25, YS50, YS75, and YS100). Metabolite abundance data were normalized by total ion current (TIC), log2(x+1)-transformed, and row-wise Z-scored for visualization. Rows are ordered by maximum absolute log2 fold change relative to the control (YS0), with columns hierarchically clustered. Color annotations indicate metabolite superclass (left), treatment group showing maximum response (right), and corresponding log2 fold change values (bar plot, right). Positive log2FC (red) indicates upregulation; negative log2FC (blue) indicates downregulation relative to YS0. Data represent group means (n = 3 trees per treatment).

Statistical methods: Metabolite abundance values were TIC-normalized (scale factor = 10^6), log2(x+1)-transformed, and Z-score standardized by row. Top 50 metabolites were selected based on max(|log2FC|) across all treatment-vs-control comparisons. Visualization was performed using ComplexHeatmap (v2.x) with colorRamp2 color mapping (Z-score range: −2 to +2). Column dendrogram was generated using hierarchical clustering with default parameters.
