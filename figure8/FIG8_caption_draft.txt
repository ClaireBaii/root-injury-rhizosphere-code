Figure 8. Procrustes analysis reveals significant congruence between root exudate metabolome and rhizosphere microbiome.

Procrustes analysis was performed to examine the correlation between the metabolome of root exudates (PCA ordination) and the rhizosphere microbial community (PCoA ordination based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) across five treatment groups (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). The significance of the Procrustes superimposition was assessed using a PROTEST permutation test with 10,000 permutations. (A) Procrustes alignment plot showing the correspondence between metabolome (circles) and microbiome (triangles) ordinations. Arrows connect matching samples, with arrow length representing the Procrustes residual (i.e., the degree of mismatch). The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the two datasets (m² = 0.47, P < 0.001). (B) Distribution of Procrustes residuals (arrow lengths) across treatment groups, visualized as box-and-jitter plots. Points represent individual samples (n = 3 per group). Colors indicate treatment levels: 0% (red), 25% (cyan), 50% (green), 75% (gray), and 100% (orange).
