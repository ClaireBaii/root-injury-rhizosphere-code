Figure 3. Alpha diversity and beta diversity of rhizosphere microbial communities under different treatments.

(A) Alpha diversity indices (Chao1, Faith's PD, Shannon, and Simpson) across treatment groups (Control, Treat1–Treat4). Individual samples are shown as gray points; group means ± SD are indicated by colored points and error bars. Significance annotations indicate Dunn's post-hoc test results (BH-adjusted P values) compared to Control (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).

(B) Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of relative abundance data. Each point represents an individual sample, colored by treatment group. PERMANOVA results (R², P value, and number of permutations) are displayed in the subtitle, indicating the proportion of variance explained by treatment effects.

Statistical analyses were performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Dunn's multiple comparison tests with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for alpha diversity, and PERMANOVA (9999 permutations) for beta diversity. Shannon index was calculated using log base 2.
